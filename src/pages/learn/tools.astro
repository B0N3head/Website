              Our Project Nights are an opportunity for our members to learn about AI 
              and get hands on experience building. We provide topics for our 
              members to learn about and work on, from beginner, to intermediate, 
              and then to advanced difficulty.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Members will work on these topics in pairs, ideally with one IT and one 
              non-IT student. This way, IT students can reinforce their knowledge while 
              non-IT students get the support they need. This makes it rewarding for 
              both. Each topic is run like a mini course: we explain the concept, give 
              its background and practical uses, and share an annotated example 
              solution. Members then complete three challenge projects to build the 
              ML model themselves.

              Our Industry Nights are an opportunity for our members to gain valuable 
              insights and guidance directly from alumni, professionals, and leaders in 
              the AI and ML industry. These events help bridge the gap between academic 
              learning and real-world applications, giving students firsthand exposure 
              to industry trends, career pathways, and practical advice for navigating 
              the field.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Industry Nights also provide a welcoming space to connect and network 
              with fellow students, researchers, and professionals within the AI, ML, 
              and broader tech community. These connections can lead to 
              mentorship opportunities, internships, and collaborations, helping 
              members grow their professional network and stay informed about the 
              evolving landscape of AI and machine learning.

                Our Social Nights are designed to give our members a chance to unwind, 
                relax, and take a well-deserved break from the pressures of studies and 
                assessments. These nights bring everyone together in a fun, casual 
                environment where you can enjoy activities that help you de-stress and 
                recharge.
            </p>

            <p>
              Whether you’re solving puzzles, teaming up for friendly games, or 
              testing your wits in lively group challenges, Social Nights are all about 
              building connections and having a good time. They’re the perfect way to 
              meet new people, strengthen friendships, and create lasting memories 
              while balancing the demands of student life.
